# AWS Projects Challenge - Day #1

That's Day #1 of my AWS Projects Challenge done!

Today I hosted my very own static website on Amazon S3:

- ✅ Created and configured an Amazon S3 bucket, complete with ACLs, versioning, and public access.
- ✅ Uploaded website content, diving deep into how static websites function and how to host them on S3.
- ✅ Tackled public access settings and fixed an interesting challenge with the website's visibility.

📸 See my journey from creating buckets to deploying a fully functional static website in my documentation below.

📢 Shoutout to all AWS learners—let's connect, share tips, and keep improving!

🙏 Big thanks to NextWork for setting up this engaging challenge. Ready for the next one!
